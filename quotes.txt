Responsive is better than fast
It's not fully shipped until it's fast
Anything added dilutes everything else
Practicality beats purity
Approachable is better than simple
Mind your words, they are important
Speak like a human
Half measures are as bad as nothing at all
Encourage flow
Non-blocking is better than blocking
Favor focus over features
Avoid administrative distraction
Design for failure
Keep it logically awesome
When you have exhausted all possibilities, remember this: you haven't
A man of words and not of deeds is like a garden full of weeds
We always find the time to do what we love
